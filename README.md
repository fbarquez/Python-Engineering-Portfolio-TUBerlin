# Python Engineering Portfolio - TU Berlin

This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises completed during the "Python for Engineers" course at TU Berlin. It demonstrates a progression from fundamental programming concepts to advanced data analysis and object-oriented modeling.

## 📁 Structure

### 1. [Fundamentals](./Fundamentals/)
Basic building blocks of Python programming.
*   **HA1_Control_Structures**: Implementation of logic, loops (for/while), and conditional statements.
*   **HA2_Functions_and_Lists**: Focus on modularization, code reuse through functions, and complex data handling with lists.

### 2. [Portfolio Projects](./Portfolio_Projects/)
Applied engineering problems using specialized libraries.
*   **PA3_Data_Processing_NumPy**: Numerical analysis and data visualization using NumPy and Matplotlib.
*   **PA4_Statistical_Analysis**: Statistical data processing and dynamic graphical representations.
*   **PA5_Object_Oriented_Model**: Software design using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to model engineering systems.

### 3. [Final Capstone](./Final_Capstone/)
*   **Individual_Final_Project**: A comprehensive, autonomous project applying all the skills acquired throughout the course.
